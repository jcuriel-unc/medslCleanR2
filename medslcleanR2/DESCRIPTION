Description: The medslcleanR2 pakcage offers a set of tools to clean fields and scytl data, and
	create maps. The 
   	name_cleanR function finds strings that are likely matches within the series of constraints
	that the user specifies for the purpose of catching spelling errors. The scytl cleaners in 
	turn work so as to read in a set of excel files downloaded from a scytl site and cleaning/
	compiling the data to be processed into MEDSL appropriate data. These functions therefore work
	to standardize and simplify the precinct cleaning process for our elections data.
